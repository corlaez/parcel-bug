https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/706


### ðŸ¤” Expected Behavior

watch and build should allow assigning to window object as `parcel index.html``

either with
* "prestart": "yarn build",
* "prestart": "yarn watch",

0. yarn start
1. in my browser console: `foo` should not be undefined
2. in my browser console: `help` should not be undefined
3. in my browser console: `helpts` should not be undefined

### ðŸ˜¯ Current Behavior
window object doesn't get any of the assigned props.

either with
* "prestart": "yarn build",
* "prestart": "yarn watch",

0.  yarn start
1. in my browser console: `foo` is undefined
2. in my browser console: `help` is undefined
3. in my browser console: `helpts` is undefined

*dev-serve behaves correctly*
